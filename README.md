Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN
Implementing an image-to-image translation model using the pix2pix framework, a type of Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). This task involves training a generator-discriminator pair where the generator learns to map input images (e.g., sketches, segmentation maps) to target outputs (e.g., realistic photos), while the discriminator evaluates the realism of the generated images. The model is trained on paired datasets, making it ideal for applications such as photo enhancement, architectural sketch translation, and artistic rendering. This hands-on project provides insight into adversarial training techniques and the power of cGANs in creative image synthesis.
